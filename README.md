# Updates!

Hello, I'm Muhammad Zubair Rizwan, and I've developed a starter e-commerce application using Next.js. This updated version features an integration with Redux Toolkit, replacing Redux, and incorporates TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer productivity.

# Next.js Ecommerce

This repo contains a work in progress Ecommerce responsive made with Next.js, Redux, Redux-persist, Hooks, SCSS and BEM. If you like it please give it a star :)

## Design

Currently, I'm in the initial phase of designing the beta version of my e-commerce platform. As I progress, I plan to customize each e-commerce site according to specific business needs and ideas. Feel free to share your requirements and ideas, and I'll incorporate them into the development process.
